# Introduction

In several previous years I have written a preview article with my research (focused on
primary sources and brokers notes) on most/all
of the companies featuring at Mello aimed at attendees wishing to do a little
research ahead of time.
I also looked at which company presentations might catch investors'
imaginations benefit from buying demand and share price rises during or after the event,
which I called the "Mello Effect".
I also sometimes produced a mini-guide that fitted inside the Mello badge to quickly check
presentation times.

Unfortunately in recent years a reliable list of attendees has not been available early
enough to complete this work and/or I have been too busy.
Furthermore, investors confidence has been so low that there was very little evidence or
prospect of any Mello Effect.
But this year we already have a reliable-looking list of 30 attendees so I should at least
be able to make a start. I intend to update this page frequently over the next few days so
please check back regularly until I replace this next with a note to say it is complete.

*AOM, Â£90m Market Cap*
The company provides software and a methodology for back office operational management targetting large enterprises. The March 2021 AIM admission seems to have been timed to capitalise on the WFH boom, especially with the WorkIQ product which
"analyses a user's interaction with their PC and the applications running on it to provide insights into how their time is spent and the performance of those employees and their employer's processes"
With the move back to the office, and latterly with AI threatening many of the jobs their software is designed to optimise, I was interested to see how they have performed compared to original forecasts and why they are now attending Mello for the first time.
