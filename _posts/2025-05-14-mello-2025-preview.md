title:  "Mello 2025 Preview"

# Introduction

In several previous years I have written a preview article with my research on most/all
of the companies featuring at Mello aimed at attendees wishing to do a little
research ahead of time.
I also looked at which company presentations might catch investors'
imaginations benefit from buying demand and share price rises during or after the event,
which I called the "Mello Effect".
I also sometimes produced a mini-guide that fitted inside the Mello badge to quickly check
presentation times.

Unfortunately in recent years a reliable list of attendees has not been available early
enough to complete this work and/or I have been too busy.
Furthermore, investors confidence has been so low that there was very little evidence or
prospect of any Mello Effect.
But this year we already have a reliable-looking list of 30 attendees so I should at least
be able to make a start. I intend to update this page frequently over the next few days so
please check back regularly until I replace this next with a note to say it is complete.
